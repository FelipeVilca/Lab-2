# Lab-2
This project uses classes that inherit from either Shape2D or Shape3D. 
The classes implement the abstract properties that they inherit from each
class and gives values for center, perimeter,
area and volume.
All classes override the ToString () method to print the name of
the shape together with the position of the midpoint, followed by other values (e.g.
radius or height / width).
The five classes that are implemented are Circle, Rectangle and Triangle as
will inherit from Shape2D, as will Sphere and Cuboid who inherit from Shape3D.
